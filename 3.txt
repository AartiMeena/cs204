For this assignment, you are required to sort an array of natural
numbers but the sorting criteria is not its value but the sum of its
digits - numbers with lower sum of digits should come before numbers
with higher sum of digits. If two numbers have the same sum, then
the numerically lower number should come first.


The input to your program will be 2 lines -

1) The first line will contain an integer 'n', terminated by a
newline. This 'n' denotes the number of elements to be sorted.

2) The second line will contain 'n' natural numbers separated by a
single space and ending in a newline. These are the numbers to be
sorted.


The output of your program will be a permutation of the numbers
given separated by a space and terminating in a new line that
represent their sorted order as per the given criterion.


For instance, if the input is the following -

4
2 1 3 4

the output should be

1 2 3 4

On the other hand, if the input is

5
100 90 1 10 500

the output should be

1 10 100 500 90
