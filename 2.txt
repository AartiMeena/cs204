Given a sequence of natural numbers, you are required to construct
a Red-Black tree with those numbers. Then, print that permutation
of the given numbers such that if one is to construct a simple
binary search tree with that permutation, the resulting tree will
be identical to the above Red-Black tree.


You are free to use the code you have written to construct such a
tree from a sequence of integers, but the code for the following
problems should not be reused from anywhere.


The input to your program will be 2 lines -

1) The first line will contain an integer 'n', terminated by a
newline. This 'n' denotes the number of elements to be inserted
into the Red-Black tree.

2) The second line will contain 'n' natural numbers separated by a
single space and ending in a newline. The numbers are to be inserted
in the tree.


The output of your program will be a line containing a permutation
of the numbers in the second line of the input.


For instance, if the input is the following,

4
1 2 3 4

the output should be

2 1 3 4
